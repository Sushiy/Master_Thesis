# Master_Thesis "Procedural Generation of Quests using GOAP"
This Project is a proof-of-concept of using the GOAP-Algorithm as a means for procedural content generation. Specifically it aims to use the deficits of an NPCs action set to model requests they can post to other NPCs (or theoretically players).

It is based on various papers on GOAP and procedural storytelling. The result wasn't exactly satisfactory, but the concept is quite promising.
I recommend generating more "high-level" content however, such as storylines and Faction/Group Goals.
